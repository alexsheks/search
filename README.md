UI-SEARCH

Responsive search design with realization of "answer-question" session through dataset of books.  Connected with a server via Flask, by sending a "POST"-request to the server. When you type in a question about events from the book, you will receive an answer, which is a part of a context from a book. So basically you will receive a text piece of a book with the answer included. Answer to the question is highlighted in cyan. Server does not work permanently, for the time being the project is still in progress. A number beneath is an accuracy measure of working neural network.
